Download and test the script yourself! You will need to store your referall details in a text file.

Details text file must contain:

Refernce Number
Year of Birth
Access Code

in this order, each in one line. 

If you'd like, you can add the datils straight to the corresponding variable e.g. yearOfBirth.send_keys("1990");

"Between January and September 2020 there were 4 million fewer referrals to outpatients than in the same period in 2019." - Health.org.uk

This script can be run automatically and easily modified to notify the user by SMS if there are any available slots to change their current appointment
